    <p>I revisit a memory</p>

    <p>The old bakery, the empty lot, every street named a state.</p>
    
    <p>No landscaping, the cheapest gravel.</p>
    
    <p>Can I recall his face? I remember the smell of his cigarettes on his clothing, in the air of the house.</p>
    
    <p>I wonder what the yard looks like now?</p>
    
    <p>I see the colors and know deeply my own associations: My grandmother’s operating system remembers the strange iron lamp better than I do.</p>
    
    <p>As far as I can remember, it was a perennial ground fixture.</p>
    
    <p>Linked: The shed with whitetail deer skulls.</p>
    
    <p>I remember the heavy iron tools, I remember the gun on the highest shelf, I remember being told to ever go in without permission.</p>
    
    <p>Linked: The open air fire pit, the clothing on the line, the dogs lined up against the fence, looking at us.</p>
    
    <p>I wonder how my cousin’s landscaping business is doing?</p>
    
    <p>I wonder how his brother is handling addiction?</p>
    
    <p>I wonder if the graffiti is still there in the underpass?</p>
    
    <p>I wonder if the desert is as vast as I remember?</p>
    
    <p>Suggestion: Retrace where you grew up. Arrange travel infrastructure to your liking.</p>
    
    <p>I remember the paved stone</p>
    
    <p>I remember the sheet metal bender</p>
    
    <p>The mailbox was made there</p>
    
    <p>Linked: Sheet metal CAD tutorials watched over the last 20 years</p>
    
    <p>Another video of my uncles</p>
    
    <p>Another video of my cousins</p>
    
    <p>Another photo of a Christmas</p>
    
    <p>Another dataset: A collection of Homies</p>
    
    <p>A collection of old magazines</p>
    
    <p>A collection of old novellas</p>
    
    <p>Highlighted in green:</p>
    
    <p>anoche te añoré aunque no te he conocido aún</p>
    
    <p>I see it in Spanish but I hear it in English:</p>
    
    <p>last night I yearned for you even though I have not met you yet</p>

    <p>When I think of the tree I see green</p>
    
    <p>When I think of the old plastic pool I see green</p>
    
    <p>When I think of the smell of the carpet, I see green</p>
    
    <p>When I think of my grandmother, I see green</p>
    
    <p>Four years ago my grandfather died</p>
    
    <p>When I think of my grandfather, I see red</p>
    
    <p>Linked: The ash tray in the shape of a paisley pattern, or maybe an ear?</p>
    
    <p>I can feel the way the smell of the cigarettes tasted, an index displays particulates in the air over the span of seventy years.</p>
    
    <p>Do I love cigarettes because my grandfather loved them?</p>
    
    <p>When I think of peak visits year-by-year, I see blue</p>
    
    <p>When I think of visiting the nearest ocean, I see nothing</p>
    
    <p>The sounds though, I can hear those</p>
    
    <p>I hear us splashing in the shallows, chasing a blue crab</p>
    
    <p>I hear someone selling us beads and mangos</p>
    
    <p>I hear the sand when we all stop talking</p>
    
    <p>I smell the gasoline from the dune buggy I cling onto</p>

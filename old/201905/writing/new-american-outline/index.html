        Six years ago, Jaden Smith tweeted a question that was quickly lampooned
        across the net. His tweet oozed both the banality of any New Age
        aphorism and the stupidity of a stoner’s observation of their
        weed-warped world, or so a lot of folks thought. In many respects he’s
        ahead of his time, and this observation in particular is one that
        strikes me as being a sleeper concept of sorts — “How can mirrors be
        real if our eyes aren’t real?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I think a lot about this tweet in the context of contemporary interface
        design, as in the planning and assembly of digital systems a person can
        touch and see and hear.

        These days, the mirrors we most often use to check our makeup or see if
        there’s gunk in our teeth are found on our phones — “smart” devices that
        coordinate an array of sensors and cutting-edge “image display” and
        “image capture” technologies to render reality within the boundaries of
        a powered physical display.
      </p>
      <img alt="1" src="mirror.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        What’s interesting about smart-devices-as-mirrors is that the eventual
        representation of the “image of the world” is explicitly and wholly a
        “model” of the world — a “model” meaning a “ human-constructed
        representation (abstraction) of something that exists in reality”.
        Physical mirrors are interesting because they have the ability to render
        reality and even warp it, but what they depict is “a physical reality”
        in the truest sense; The physical qualities of a mirror can be seen as
        akin to seeing the world through air, or seeing the world through water.
        While a human being can physically manipulate a physical mirror to alter
        the final reflection, the reflection in and of itself is a product of
        the physical world and unalterable in totality.
      </p>
      <p>
        To a degree, film photography was an extension of this physical
        realization (rendering) of reality. At a certain point, what else is the
        capture of light on paper but a wholly physical process? While people
        intervened in the path of light’s travel with lenses and apertures and
        specifically-designed crystal-studded paper, what emerges as a process
        is less a constructed model of reality and more a continually warped
        representation of <em>what actually exists</em> in the world. Film and
        paper photography was a deeply labor-intensive art, full of cutting and
        cropping and poisoning and brushwork, all serving the act of rendering
        what was once a beam of light into an image-rendering of a particular
        summer day. Impressionism lives on in this sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t until recently that most photographs became literal
        abstractions or literal models of thought with the advent of digital
        photographic capture. While the earliest digital photographs presented
        terrible image quality/resolution, they were possibly the most honest
        representations of what they actually were: a product of humans
        manipulating bits through clever mathematic compression to render blocks
        of color accordingly.

      <p>“How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren’t real?”</p>

      <p>
        What we “see” in our screens is wholly a model of reality, wholly an
        abstraction of the natural world, wholly determined and manufactured by
        people sitting in an office in California somewhere, typing away at an
        IDE. When we strip away the image rendered on a screen, when we
        deconstruct an algorithm, what’s left?
      </p>
      <p>
        What does it mean when most models (abstractions) of our digital
        representations are constructed in California, or completely in America
        for that matter?

        When I look at myself on my phone camera, why do I get the haunting
        feeling I’m not situated in New York anymore? When I scroll through all
        the photos of friends and strangers on Facebook or Twitter, why does it
        all feel so flat? When I tap through my friend’s stories on Instagram
        and get interrupted by an ad for shoes, why does the shoe ad feel more
        real than the stories it’s sandwiched between?
      </p>

      <p>Stories</p>
      <img alt="1" src="dab.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        In July of 2016, Kevin Systrom (the CEO of Instagram) unveiled the
        latest feature set to the eponymous app — Stories. He had a particularly
        interesting take on their most recent product feature, revealed in an
        interview with The Verge:
      </p>
      <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
        <p>
          Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder and CEO, credits Snapchat for
          developing the stories format. But he says it was always bound to
          surface in other apps. &#8220;My thesis is a story is a slideshow
          format,&#8221; Systrom said in an interview with The Verge.
          &#8220;Just like when Facebook invented the [News] Feed, and every
          social product was like, ‘That’s an innovation, how do we adapt that
          to our network?’ You’re going to see stories pop up in other networks
          over time, because it’s one of the best ways to show visual
          information in chronological order.&#8221;
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        When I think of formats, I most often think of the formats I encountered
        in my youth: Micro-cassettes, CD-Rs, DVDs, 3.5 inch floppy disks, even.
        In an expanded sense thanks to schooling and self-education I now
        nurture the impression that ISO-standard self-tapping screws are a
        certain format, sizes of wood slats are formats, the standard red brick
        is a format that building-forms find themselves expressed through. It’s
        interesting to think of “interfaces” as adopting something one would
        call a format, or becoming formats themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The physical world is constructed from a vast number of standards that
        make things as simple as bricks possible. Likewise, digital interfaces
        are constructed through a vast number of technologies most people will
        never (and some argue, should) think about.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that matter, most digital interface designers will never consider
        how the buttons they specify on-screen are handled by TCP/IP or the
        thousands of heavy metal physical servers that populate buttons they
        specify and “style” once in CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I paint, I take a simple object, daub it with something that makes
        a mark, and paint it on a surface. What I’ve just created is a format of
        art. The word “Hello” is a world unto itself when displayed on a
        webpage. The technology that made our digital-text “Hello” possible is
        vast beyond belief. Is the world a format?

      <p>New American Interfaces</p>
      <p>
        When we talk about “New American Interfaces”, it’s important to expand
        upon the meaning of each word for a complete sense of the conceptual
        picture we’re trying to paint.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should imagine “New American Interfaces” to be less a definition,
        more an expansion. Less an encircling and more an
        <a href="https://www.are.na/block/736425">arrangement collage</a> of
        existing realities.
      </p>

        “New”ness is a direct reference to developments in human technology that
        span the last 10 years or so. “New” American technology does not refer
        to technology that was developed in the 1970s. “New” American Technology
        is not a reference to networking protocols or personal computers
        proliferating in the 90s. “Newness” refers to mobile phones finding
        themselves in billions of people’s hands and pockets. “Newness” refers
        to the viability of video streaming over wireless networks. “New”
        implies cameras directly imbued with the capability to re-model reality
        and assign social value through “the arrangement of certain interfaces”
        only found in the most cutting-edge devices. “New”ness implies the
        forgetting of the massive stacks of technology that exist to show us
        images of our friends and their lives in chronological order.

        “America” speaks to the “Americanness” of the current world. Totalizing
        global governance, military might, far-reaching memetic saturation the
        rest of the world cannot escape from. “America” means pop culture,
        “America” means world police. “America” retains the ability to wobble
        the economy of the world when executives shitpost on Twitter. When we
        talk about “America”, we mean the hegemonic cultural-economic
        infrastructure the rest of the world rests upon whether they like it or
        not.

        “Interfaces” speak to not <em>any</em> button, slider, or like button
        physical or digital or otherwise. “Interfaces” in the sense of “New
        American” interfaces refer to what Kevin Systrom meant when he called
        Snapchat a “format”. A replicable stack(s) of technology is an
        “interface”. An “interface” under this definition means every chat
        application is fundamentally the same and completely interchangeable.
        Linear conversation will always be linear conversation, and the pattern
        of linear conversation is what we call a messaging app, and we call this
        an “interface”. Every search interface is the same, every index is the
        same, every captive portal is the same. To take our example to the
        physical world, imagine this scene:
      </p>
      <p>
        You see two chairs side by side with one another. From afar, they are
        completely the same. You inspect them close and they are the same, you
        notice they both are built from the same beautiful ash wood, every
        single detail is perfectly mirrored in both chairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of these chairs was wholly made by human hands and the other was cut
        to shape by a machine, assembled by people on a factory line, and
        produced in the millions.
      </p>
      <p>One of these chairs is an interface —</p>

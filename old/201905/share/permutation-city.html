<h2 class='sectionHeading'>PROLOGUE</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 209</div><div class='noteText'>Urine and feces production were optional – some Copies wished to retain every possible aspect of corporeal life – but Paul had chosen to do without . ( So much for smearing himself in excrement . ) His bodily wastes would be magicked out of existence long before reaching bladder or bowel . Ignored out of existence ; passively annihilated . All that it took to destroy something , here , was to fail to keep track of it .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 1</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 328</div><div class='noteText'>Upstairs , in the bedroom that doubled as an office , Maria switched on her terminal and glanced at a summary of the twenty - one items of mail which had arrived since she’d last checked . All were classified as “ Junk ” ; there was nothing from anyone she knew – and nothing remotely like an offer of paid work . Camel’s Eye , her screening software , had identified six pleas for donations from charities ( all worthy causes , but Maria hardened her heart ) ; five invitations to enter lotteries and competitions ; seven retail catalogs ( all of which boasted that they’d been tailored to her personality and “ current lifestyle requirements ” – but Camel’s Eye had assessed their contents and found nothing of interest ) ; and three interactives .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 335</div><div class='noteText'>The “ dumb ” audio - visual mail was all in standard , transparent data formats , but interactives were executable programs , machine code with heavily encrypted data , intentionally designed to be easier for a human to talk to than for screening software to examine and summarize . Camel’s Eye had run all three interactives ( on a doubly - quarantined virtual machine – a simulation of a computer running a simulation of a computer ) and tried to fool them into thinking that they were making their pitch to the real Maria Deluca . Two sales programs – superannuation and health insurance – had fallen for it , but the third had somehow deduced its true environment , and clammed up before disclosing anything . In theory , it was possible for Camel’s Eye to analyze the program and figure out exactly what it would have said if it had been fooled ; in practice , that could take weeks . The choice came down to trashing it blind , or talking to it in person .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 342</div><div class='noteText'>Maria ran the interactive . A man’s face appeared on the terminal ; “ he ” met her gaze and smiled warmly , and she suddenly realized that “ he ” bore a slight resemblance to Aden . Close enough to elicit a flicker of recognition which the mask of herself she’d set up for Camel’s Eye would not have exhibited ? Maria felt a mixture of annoyance and grudging admiration . She’d never shared an address with Aden – but no doubt the data analysis agencies correlated credit card use in restaurants , or whatever , to pick up relationships which didn’t involve cohabitation . Mapping useful connections between consumers had been going on for decades – but employing the data in this way , as a reality test , was a new twist .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 348</div><div class='noteText'>The junk mail , now rightly convinced that it was talking to a human being , began the spiel it had refused to waste on her digital proxy . “ Maria , I know your time is valuable , but I hope you can spare a few seconds to hear me out . ” It paused for a moment , to make her feel that her silence was some kind of assent . “ I also know that you’re a highly intelligent , discerning woman , with no interest whatsoever in the muddled , irrational superstitions of the past , the fairy tales that comforted humanity in its infancy . ” Maria guessed what was coming next ; the interactive saw it on her face – she hadn’t bothered to hide behind any kind of filter – and it rushed to get a hook in . “ No truly intelligent person , though , ever dismisses an idea without taking the trouble to evaluate it – skeptically , but fairly – and here at the Church of the God Who Makes No Difference — ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 358</div><div class='noteText'>A brief silence followed . Maria imagined the synaptic weighting parameters being juggled in the mask’s neural net , as the training algorithm hunted for values which would guarantee the required response . She thought : If I keep on doing this , the mask is going to end up as much like me as a fully - fledged Copy . And what’s the point of saving yourself from the tedium of talking to junk mail if … you’re not ? It was a deeply unpleasant notion … but masks were orders of magnitude less sophisticated than Copies ; they had about as many neurons as the average goldfish – organized in a far less human fashion . Worrying about their “ experience ” would be as ludicrous as feeling guilty about terminating junk mail . Camel’s Eye said , “ Done . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 2</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 659</div><div class='noteText'>Thomas said , “ Of course not – but I’ll tell you what would be ‘ tolerated ’ : scanning facilities , and computing power , so cheap that everyone on the planet could be resurrected . Everyone who wanted it . And when I say cheap , I mean at a cost comparable to a dose of vaccine at the turn of the century . Imagine that . Death could be eradicated – like smallpox or malaria . And I’m not talking about some solipsistic nightmare ; by then , telepresence robots will let Copies interact with the physical world as fully as if they were human . Civilization wouldn’t have deserted reality – just transcended biology . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 669</div><div class='noteText'>Even in secular Europe , there’s a deeply ingrained prejudice that says dying is the responsible , the moral thing to do . There’s a Death Ethic – and the first substantial segment of the population abandoning it will trigger a huge backlash .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 673</div><div class='noteText'>“ We may be unpopular for a while . I can live with that . But you know , even now we’re vilified far less than people who strive for organic hyperlongevity – transplants , cellular rejuvenation , whatever – because at least we’re no longer pushing up the cost of health care , competing for the use of overburdened medical facilities . Nor are we consuming natural resources at anything like the rate we did when we were alive . If the technology improves sufficiently , the environmental impact of the wealthiest Copy could end up being less than that of the most ascetic living human . Who’ll have the high moral ground , then ? We’ll be the most ecologically sound people on the planet . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 3</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 760</div><div class='noteText'>It was as if every dubious promise technology had ever made to transform human life was about to be fulfilled , with a vengeance . Longevity would only be the start of it ; Copies could evolve in ways almost impossible for organic beings : modifying their minds , redefining their goals , endlessly transmuting themselves . The possibilities were intoxicating – even as the costs and drawbacks of the earliest versions sank in , even as the inevitable backlash began . Paul was a child of the millennium ; he was ready to embrace it all .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 4</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 990</div><div class='noteText'>“ What’s so terrible about that ? ” “ You mean , apart from the sheer technocratic hubris ? And apart from the fact that releasing any kind of replicator into the environment is – still , thankfully – illegal ? It wouldn’t have worked . There were complications nobody had predicted – unstable mixing of air layers , wasn’t it ? – which would have counteracted most of the effect . ” Maria said , “ Exactly . But how would anyone have known that , if they hadn’t run a proper simulation ? ” “ Common sense . This whole idea of throwing technology at problems created by technology … ” Maria felt her patience desert her . “ What would you rather do ? Be humble in the presence of nature , and hope you’ll be rewarded for it ? You think Mother Gaia is going to forgive us , and put everything right – just as soon as we throw away our wicked computers and promise to stop trying to fix things ourselves ? ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 5</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1349</div><div class='noteText'>In twelve short real - time years as a Copy , he’d tried to explore every possibility , map out every consequence of what he’d become . He’d transformed his surroundings , his body , his personality , his perceptions – but he’d always owned the experience himself . The tricks he’d played on his memory had added , never erased – and whatever changes he’d been through , there was always only one person , in the end , taking responsibility , picking up the pieces . One witness , unifying it all . The truth was , the thought of finally surrendering that unity made him dizzy with fear . It was the last vestige of his delusion of humanity . The last big lie .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1355</div><div class='noteText'>And as Daniel Lebesgue , founder of Solipsist Nation , had written : “ My goal is to take everything which might be revered as quintessentially human … and grind it into dust . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 8</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1702</div><div class='noteText'>He sighed , and took another swig of C &amp; O . It was a balancing act , a tightrope walk . A Copy could go insane , either way . Caring too much about the truth could lead to a pathological obsession with the infrastructure – the algorithms and optical processors , the machinery of “ deception ” which lay beneath every surface . Caring too little , you could find yourself gradually surrendering to a complacent fantasy in which life had gone on as normal , and everything which contradicted the illusion of ordinary physical existence was avoided , or explained away .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1756</div><div class='noteText'>“ Most flesh - and - blood humans live and die without knowing or caring what they are – scoffing at the very idea that it should matter . But you’re not flesh - and - blood , and you can’t afford the luxury of ignorance . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1762</div><div class='noteText'>He wondered if it was only a matter of time before vanity got the better of him , and he did the same with his appearance . Many of his business associates were un - aging gradually – but a few had leaped back twenty , thirty , fifty years , or changed their appearances completely . Which was most honest ? Looking like an eighty - five - year - old flesh - and - blood human ( which he was not ) , or looking the way he’d prefer to look … prefer to be … given the choice . And he did have the choice . He closed his eyes , put his fingertips to his cheek , explored the damaged skin . If he believed these ruins defined him , they defined him … and if he learned to accept a new young body , the same would be true of it . And yet , he couldn’t shake the notion that external rejuvenation would entail nothing more than constructing a youthful “ mask ” … while his “ true face ” continued to exist – and age – somewhere . Pure Dorian Gray – a stupid moralistic fable stuffed with “ eternal ” verities long obsolete .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1794</div><div class='noteText'>He almost laughed , but his newly combed expression discouraged it . Expediency , honesty , complacency , insanity . It was a tightrope walk . He was ninety years old by one measure , eighty - five - and - a - half by another – and he still didn’t know how to live . On his way out , he picked up his Confidence &amp; Optimism and poured it on the carpet .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 9</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1801</div><div class='noteText'>He was tired of having to think about what he was , every waking moment . The streets around the building were familiar enough , not to let him delude himself , but at least to allow him to take himself for granted .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Location 1802</div><div class='noteText'>written ffom perspective of swm ofc</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1819</div><div class='noteText'>Suppose an intentionally haywire computer sat for a thousand years or more , twitching from state to state in the sway of nothing but electrical noise . Might it embody consciousness ? In real time , the answer was : probably not – the probability of any kind of coherence arising at random being so small . Real time , though , was only one possible reference frame ; what about all the others ? If the states the machine passed through could be rearranged in time arbitrarily , then who could say what kind of elaborate order might emerge from the chaos ?</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 10</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1853</div><div class='noteText'>Durham was apologetic . “ There’s no reason why you would have heard of me . I’m afraid I’ve always confined myself to reading the articles ; I’ve never contributed anything , or participated in the conferences . I don’t actually work in the Autoverse , myself . I don’t have the time . Or the skills , to be honest . ” Maria absorbed that , trying not to appear too startled . It was like hearing someone admit that they studied chess , but never played the game .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 11</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2199</div><div class='noteText'>Peer said nothing . He realized that , in spite of his doubts , he’d almost certainly follow her – and not just for the shock of creating a second version , not just for the sake of undermining his last anthropomorphic delusions . The truth was , he wanted to be with her . All of her . If he backed out and she went ahead , the knowledge that he’d passed up his one opportunity to have a version of himself accompany her would drive him mad . He wasn’t sure if this was greed or affection , jealousy or loyalty – but he knew he had to be a part of whatever she experienced in there . It was an unsettling revelation . Peer took a snapshot of his state of mind .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2225</div><div class='noteText'>Peer could empathize , to a degree . What was the point of being scanned , only to remain enslaved by an obsolete respect for the body’s fragility ? Having triumphed over mortality , how could he have gone on living as if nothing had changed ? Every biological instinct , every commonsense idea about the nature of survival had been rendered absurd – and he hadn’t been able to resist the urge to dramatize the transformation . That didn’t prove that he’d wanted to die .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2236</div><div class='noteText'>With care , he could have died at the age of a hundred and fifty , to become an instant member of the elite – perhaps , by then , in a cybernetic body barely distinguishable from the real thing . But having paid for the right not to fear death , at some level he must have confused the kind of abstract , literary , morally - charged , beloved - of - fate immortality possessed by mythical heroes and virtuous believers in the afterlife , with the highly specific free - market version he’d actually signed up for .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2295</div><div class='noteText'>She’d helped him redesign his apartment , transforming it from a photorealist concrete box into a system of perceptions which could be as stable , or responsive , as he wished . Once , before sleep , he’d wrapped the structure around himself like a sleeping bag , shrinking and softening it until the kitchen cradled his head , and the other rooms draped his body . He’d changed the topology so that every window looked in through another window , every wall abutted another wall ; the whole thing closed in on itself in every direction , finite but borderless , universe - as - womb .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2353</div><div class='noteText'>That first change , though , had cleared the way for many more , a long series of self - directed mutations . Peer ( by choice ) had no patience with nostalgia or sentimentality ; if any part of his personality offended him , he struck it out . Some traits had ( most likely ) vanished forever : a horde of petty jealousies , vanities , misgivings , and pointless obsessions ; a tendency to irrational depression and guilt . Others came and went . Peer had acquired , removed , and restored , a variety of talents , mood predispositions , and drives ; cravings for knowledge , art , and physical experience . In a few subjective days , he could change from an ascetic bodiless student of Sumerian archaeology , to a hedonistic gastronome delighting in nothing more than the preparation and consumption of lavishly simulated feasts , to a disciplined practitioner of Shotokan karate . A core remained ; certain values , certain emotional responses , certain esthetic sensibilities had survived these transitions unscathed . As had the will to survive itself . Peer had once asked himself : Was that kernel of invariants – and the more - or - less unbroken thread of memory – enough ? Had David Hawthorne , by another name , achieved the immortality he’d paid for ? Or had he died somewhere along the way ?</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 12</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2378</div><div class='noteText'>Squeak . “ Trial number one . Model partitioned into five hundred sections , run on five hundred processor clusters , distributed globally . ” Paul counted . Five hundred clusters . Five only for the crudely modeled external world ; all the rest were allocated to his body – and most to the brain . He lifted his hand to his eyes – and the information flow that granted him motor control and sight traversed tens of thousands of kilometers of optical cable . There was no ( perceptible ) delay ; each part of him simply hibernated when necessary , waiting for the requisite feedback from around the world . It was , of course , pure lunacy , computationally and economically ; Paul guessed that he was costing at least a hundred times as much as usual – not quite five hundred , since each cluster’s capacity was only being partly used – and his slowdown factor had probably risen from seventeen to as much as fifty . Once it had been hoped that devoting hundreds of computers to each Copy might improve the slowdown problem , not worsen it – but the bottlenecks in shifting data between processor clusters kept even the richest Copies from reducing the factor below seventeen . It didn’t matter how many supercomputers you owned , because splitting yourself between them wasted more time on communications than was saved by the additional computing power .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2389</div><div class='noteText'>Squeak . “ Trial number two . One thousand sections , one thousand clusters . ” Brain the size of a planet – and here I am , counting to ten . Paul recalled the perennial – naïve and paranoid – fear that all the networked computers of the world might one day spontaneously give birth to a global hypermind – but he was , almost certainly , the first planet - sized intelligence on Earth . He didn’t feel much like a digital Gaia , though . He felt exactly like an ordinary human being sitting in a room a few meters wide .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 16</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3223</div><div class='noteText'>He reread and replayed the news reports that he’d accessed from inside – and found no discrepancies . He flicked through encyclopedic databases – spot - checking random facts of history , geography , astronomy – and although he was surprised now and then by details which he’d never come across before , there were no startling contradictions . The continents hadn’t moved . Stars and planets hadn’t vanished . The same wars had been lost and won . Everything was consistent . Everything was explicable . And yet he couldn’t stop wondering about the fate of a Copy who was shut down , and never run again . A normal human death was one thing – woven into a much vaster tapestry , it was a process which made perfect sense . From the internal point of view of a Copy whose model was simply halted , though , there was no explanation whatsoever for its demise – just an edge where the pattern abruptly came to an end .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 18</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3601</div><div class='noteText'>The clone met his eyes . Peer did his best not to look relieved – short of severing ties with his body . He tried to read the clone’s expression , and failed ; all he saw was a reflection of his own growing numbness . Pirandello had said it was impossible to feel any real emotion while staring into a mirror . Peer decided to take that as a good sign . They were still one person , after all – and that was the whole point .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 19</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3647</div><div class='noteText'>In fact , if Durham was right – if the events he believed would take place in his TVC universe could find themselves in the dust – then those events would happen , regardless . It could make no difference what anyone did in this world . The whole Garden of Eden project was superfluous . Every permutation of the dust which was capable of perceiving itself , making sense of itself , would do just that . And all she would have achieved by refusing to be scanned would have been to deny the Maria of that permutation a history which seemed to overlap with her own particular life . While a third woman – in another world , another permutation – would have taken her place in that role .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3739</div><div class='noteText'>Maria didn’t even know what she was angry about any more : the delayed launch , the obscene waste of money – or just Durham sitting there making perfect sense to himself , as always . She said , “ The project is a joke . Three hundred million people are living in refugee camps , and you’re offering sanctuary to sixteen billionaires ! What do they need protection from ? There’s never going to be an anti - Copy revolution ! They’re never going to be shut down ! You know as well as I do that they’ll just sit there getting richer for the next ten thousand years ! ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3865</div><div class='noteText'>“ She was a child of the nineties . Her kindergarten teachers probably told her that the pinnacle of her existence would be fertilizing a rainforest when she died . ” Maria thought it over . “ And the beauty of it is … she can still do that . Scan her , put her through a meat grinder … scatter the results over the Daintree . ” “ You’re a sick woman . ” “ I’ll have the money soon . I can afford to joke . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 3902</div><div class='noteText'>They waited , passing the time checking software more or less at random , displaying everything from firing patterns in the Copy’s model brain to statistics on the performance of the TVC computers . Intuitively , the elaborate hierarchy of simulations within simulations seemed vulnerable , unstable – every level multiplying the potential for disaster . But if the set - up resembled a house of cards , it was a simulated house of cards : perfectly balanced in a universe free of vibrations and breezes . Maria was satisfied that the architecture at every level was flawless – so long as the level beneath held up . It would take a glitch in the real - world hardware to bring the whole thing tumbling down . That was rare , though not impossible .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 24</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 4558</div><div class='noteText'>She turned toward him , parting her hair to show one baleful eye . “ You’re fooling yourself , you know . You’re going to repeat yourself , eventually . However desperately you reprogram yourself , in the end you’re going to come full circle , and find that you’ve done it all before . ” Peer laughed indulgently , and shouted , “ We’ve certainly been through all this before – and you know that’s not true . It’s always possible to synthesize something new : a novel art form , a new field of study . A new esthetic , a new obsession . ” Falling through the cool late afternoon air beside her was exhilarating , but he was already missing the smell of wood dust .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 4572</div><div class='noteText'>“ Why do you have to find everything so … fulfilling ? Why can’t you discriminate ? Why can’t you let yourself grow bored with things – then move on ? Pick them up again later if you feel the urge . ” “ Sounds awfully quaint to me . Very human . ” “ It did work for them . Sometimes . ” “ Yes . And I’m sure it works for you , sometimes . You drift back and forth between your art , and watching the great Elysian soap opera . With a decade or two of aimless depression in between . You’re dissatisfied most of the time – and letting that happen is a conscious choice , as deliberate , and arbitrary , as anything I impose on myself . If that’s how you want to live , I’m not going to try to change you . But you can’t expect me to live the same way . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 4596</div><div class='noteText'>He rolled over and looked down at the City – or the strange recursive map of the City which they made do with , buried as they were in the walls and foundations of the real thing . Malcolm Carter’s secret parasitic software wasn’t blind to its host ; they could spy on what was going on in the higher levels of the program which surreptitiously ran them , even though they couldn’t affect anything which happened there . They could snatch brief , partial recordings of activity in the real City , and play them back in a limited duplicate environment . It was a bit like … being the widely - separated letters in the text of Ulysses which read : Peer and Kate read , “ Leopold Bloom wandered through Dublin . ” If not quite so crude an abridgment .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 4645</div><div class='noteText'>Peer had spent some time inhabiting the bodies of animals , both historical and mythical , and he’d enjoyed them all – but when the phase was over , he’d found that with very little rewiring , he could make the human form feel every bit as good . It seemed more elegant to be comfortable with his ancestral physiology . The majority of Elysians apparently agreed .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 4729</div><div class='noteText'>Repetto paused ; he grew perceptibly taller , and his youthful features became subtly more dignified , more mature . Most Elysians would see this as no more manipulative than a change in posture , or tone of voice .</h3>

    <p>Redesigning Tumblr&#x27;s Onboarding</p>

      <p>Tumblr is a social network that popularized the concept of short-form “microblogging” around the time of its creation in 2007. Since then, Tumblr has become a cultural/memetic engine thanks to the people and fandoms that inhabit it.</p>
<p>I joined Tumblr in late 2015 where I was one of three product designers interfacing with six product managers, a team of around 50 product engineers, and numerous researchers, QA staff, a small brand team, and a dozen engineering leads.</p>
<p>After Yahoo (and by extension, Tumblr) was acquired by Oath, company-wide priorities were switched over to integrating core advertising technologies between Oath and its subsidiaries, and the integration of systems such as GDPR.</p>
<p>I worked closely with a product manager and a few engineering leads to navigate various “streams of work and reshuffled prioritization hierarchies” during the redesign of user onboarding, a project which had been dragging on for months.</p>
<p>In order for “new onboarding” to be successful, we needed the following to be true of our work:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Every aspect</em> of the newly-structured onboarding needed to exude our new brand</li>
<li>Onboarding needed to integrate a combined “Oath Terms and GDPR Acceptance interface”</li>
<li>Onboarding needed to successfully convert creators of new accounts into lasting users by means of immediately depicting Tumblr’s value.</li>
</ol>

<p>It all started with the desire to unite the <a href="https://medium.com/@thisisdougrichard/some-updates-to-tumblr-112876234c2d">efforts the brand team had been actively outputting</a> and the actual expression of the product. As the creative team was tightly knit, this movement was sort of a grassroots effort that we had to communicate to the rest of the company, rather than an overt company direction we were told to take.</p>
